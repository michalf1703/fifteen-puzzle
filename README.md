### 1. Goal

This task consisted of two elements: a programming part and a research part. In the programming part, the goal was to write a program that would solve the puzzle using various methods of state space search. In the research part, we analyzed the behavior of these methods in relation to the given problem.

#### 2.1 Tools Used

To accomplish the task, we utilized the Python programming language and its libraries. For implementing BFS (Breadth-First Search) and A* algorithms, we used the Collections library and the Queue module. Additionally, for visualization purposes, we employed the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries.
